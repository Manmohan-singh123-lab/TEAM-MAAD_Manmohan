<b> Experiment|     <b> Design a front end BPSK modulator and demodulator.
 
### About the Experiment 
This experiment demonstrates the practical implementation of BPSK using RF front-end components. It includes the generation of a BPSK signal, its transmission over a wireless channel, and reception using mixers, filters, and demodulators. The goal is to understand how BPSK works in real-world communication systems, considering noise, synchronization, and hardware imperfections.
